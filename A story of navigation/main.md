# A little story of navigation
_or the importance of continuous testing (even when sailing)_

> _**TAGLINE**: often is better than more_

Once upon a time, there was a shipowner who, one day, took one of his sailors, bring him to the top of the cliff, and said: "I have some goods that I want to sell to the people living in the isle you see there in the sea. Please take a boat and deliver them for me".

The sailor watched as better as he could the isle to determine the route and then came down from the cliff. He took a rowboat, filled it with the goods indicated by the owner, and set sail going backwards (this is how you drive a rowboat).

For some time he followed the direction determined on the cliff, rowing at a good pace.

In the meanwhile, an older sailor climbed the top of the cliff and watching the travel of the boat realized something the younger sailor still not had noticed: a strong tide was taking the boat far from the route.

He could do nothing to help but anyway took the phone and called the isle to leave a message to the sailor.

The sailor, in the meanwhile, continued to row hard until, according to his calculations, enough time had passed to be close to the island. After a while it was.

Indeed he was able to see the isle but, he discovered with horror, the isle was a lot more on the left than it should be. Of course, there had to be a strong tide that was taking him away from his original route.

He took the compass, shook his hands on the oars, adjusted the direction, and started rowing hard against the tide to come back on route.

He made an unspeakable effort and spent a lot of strength but in the end, he adjusted the route and landed in the isle.

After he delivered the goods, he was given the message left by the older sailr and with this precious advice in mind started coming back with the money from the sale.

This time he was able to follow the route and come back on time, less exhausted and generally happier.

The end.

One last thing: curious to know what was the advice left by the older sailor? 

Here it is
